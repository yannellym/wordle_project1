# Android Project 1 - WordleLite

Submitted by: Yannelly Mercado

WordleLite is an android app that recreates a simple version of the popular word game [Wordle] (https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html). 

Time spent: a few hours in the span of 4 days

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [X] **User has 3 chances to guess a random 4 letter word**
- [X] **After 3 guesses, user should no longer be able to submit another guess**
- [X] **After each guess, user sees the "correctness" of the guess**
- [X] **After all guesses are taken, user can see the target word displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] User can toggle betweeen different word lists
- [ ] User can see the 'correctness' of their guess through colors on the word 
- [X] User sees a visual change after guessing the correct word
- [X] User can tap a 'Reset' button to get a new word and clear previous guesses
- [X] User will get an error message if they input an invalid guess
- [ ] User can see a 'streak' record of how many words they've guessed correctly.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* Features I wish I could have implemented: adding the Konfetti animation, implementing the changing of the letter's colors, and adding a steak for correctness

## Notes

Challenges faced when creating the app: I'm very familiar with Python's and Javascript's syntax. I know the basic of Java, and I'm currently learning Kotlin. The difficult part was getting to structure my project's code in a way that made sense. Also, trying to figure out the correct syntax for the project.
While I started off with sloppy code, I was able to research the proper ways of writing the code in Kotlin. I added comments throughout so I can remember the syntax for next time.
